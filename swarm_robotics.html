            </i>Swarm robotics is the use of a large number of robots to complete a task which a single robot could
            not. In our design, the robots have three major functions: moving, communicating, and sensing. Using these
            three abilities in conjunction, we aim to use the swarm to map out the layout of our high school's campus.

                Received our order of additional Raspberry Pi 3Bs for future robots,
                our first robot chassis (wild thumper 4WD chassis with suspension - pictured below),
                batteries to power the robots (7.2v. 3000mvh) and an HR-SR04 ultrasonic sensor (pictured below)
                which we will begin testing next week. We were working on imaging Raspberry Pis with Raspbian, but will
                most likely use <a href="https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/">Ubuntu with ROS Kinetic</a> to
                facilitate the use of that system. Additionally, we began building the
                <a href="https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/">
                    circuit for the ultrasonic</a>,
                which will be driving the majority of the object detection in our system. We also started
                applying to additional grants in the local area in order to secure extra funding.
                Finally, we ordered the motor controller for the robot and plan on testing full motion and
                functionality into next week.

                Began setting up Raspberry Pis for prototyping and swarm simulations. This involved downloading and
                installing <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/">Raspbian through NOOBS</a>. We
                were only able to successfully boot up one computer at this time, most likely due to the SD cards used
                to install Raspbian on the other machines.

                Researched software for swarm simulation and controlling robots. Based on previous research, the
                primary operation system to control robots, outside of writing our own software, is the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Introduction">Robot
                    Operating System (ROS)</a>. An open source software, ROS seems to have a quite extensive
                community
                and codebase to work from. There are a few projects by other users which involve swarm
                communications,
                which provides a nice starting point to guide our algorithms. In terms of simulations, we looked at
                a few different options including <a href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/Stage-3.2.1/index.html">Stage</a>,
                a simulator for swarm robotics, and <a href="https://www.argos-sim.info/concepts.php">ARGoS</a>, a
                large-scale robot simulator. Both seem like accurate and useful simulators, but our final decision
                is to use <a href="http://gazebosim.org/">Gazebo</a> due to its close ties with the ROS community.
                Gazebo will allow us to visualize the interactions within the robot swarm and develop an algorithm for
                the mapping algorithm before building a physical swarm, and can also allow us to predict how the
                algorithm will scale up if more robot were added to the swarm.

                    research proposal</a>. Additionally, we continued to look for a robot kit and corresponding
                electronics.
                The kit we will prototype with is the <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/1567">Wild Thumper</a>
                chassis, with <a href="http://www.dagurobot.com/DAGU_Wild_Thumper_encoders_RS003_Enco_with_motor_75_1?search=wild%20thumper&category_id=0">

                    this battery</a>. We chose this chassis for various reasons. The four wheel drive and
                suspension allows the robot to drive comfortably in all terrain types. The chassis also has plenty of
                room for sensors, and the dimensions of the robot are ideal for our purpose. We also plan to order
                multiple Raspberry Pis to begin the prototyping and simulation processes.

                Modified the future work timeline in order to put greater importance on the swarm rather than
                individual robot design. Also, we decided to purchase a robot from a kit, instead of trying to
                design and manufacture all components of the robots. Some of the designs that we are considering
                include the <a href="https://www.robotshop.com/en/dfrobotshop-rover-tracked-robot-basic-kit.html">

                We also have prepared a rough draft for our formal research proposal, which will be submitted by
                September 20. Our next steps are to begin testing communications between Raspberry Pi units, which
                should help us form the basis of cross-robot communications in the swarm.
