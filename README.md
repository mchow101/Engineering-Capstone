# Engineering-Capstone
Engineering Capstone is a rigorous year long course which will guide students' thinking and research around a complex engineering challenge. The 2019-2020 school year is the first time that this opportunity is available to students at Pacific Grove High School. We hope to inspire students to pursue their interests in STEM, teach them to solve complex issues through research and experimentation, and finally, give them experience in modern research techniques.
